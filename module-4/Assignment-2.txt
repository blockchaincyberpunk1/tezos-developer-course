Secure Smart Contract Development

Course: Tezos Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to reinforce best practices for writing secure Tezos smart contracts. Students will apply their knowledge by developing a Tezos smart contract that follows established security guidelines and coding standards. They will document the security features they implement and explain how these features enhance contract security.

Instructions:

Assignment Task:

Develop a Secure Smart Contract (60 points):

Contract Design (10 points):

Instruct students to choose a simple use case for their Tezos smart contract (e.g., a token contract, a voting contract, a crowdfunding contract).
Require them to design the contract's structure and functionality, considering potential security risks.
Coding Standards (10 points):

Provide students with coding standards and guidelines for Tezos smart contracts.
Encourage them to follow these standards throughout the development process.
Security Features Implementation (20 points):

Require students to implement specific security features in their smart contract. These features can include:
Input validation to prevent invalid data entry.
Authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can execute certain functions.
Gas limits to prevent potential gas-related vulnerabilities.
Error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations.
Self-destruct mechanisms or pause functions for emergency situations.
Documentation of Security Features (20 points):

Request that students document the security features they implemented, explaining the purpose and functionality of each feature.
Emphasize the importance of providing clear explanations of how these features enhance contract security.
Documentation (30 points):

Instruct students to create a comprehensive report that includes the following:
Contract design description.
Code snippets or the entire smart contract code.
Documentation of security features and their implementations.
Explanations of how each security feature enhances contract security.
Presentation (10 points):

Organize a presentation session where students will present their secure smart contract and the security features they implemented.
Each student should explain the design choices made and how their security features mitigate potential risks.
Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their secure smart contract code and the comprehensive report to the instructor or the designated platform provided for the assignment.
