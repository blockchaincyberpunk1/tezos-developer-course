Vulnerability Analysis

Course: Tezos Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to help students develop the skills to identify common vulnerabilities in Tezos smart contracts. By analyzing sample contracts containing vulnerabilities, students will gain a deeper understanding of potential pitfalls and best practices for secure smart contract development. They will also learn how to propose solutions to fix these issues.

Instructions:

Assignment Task:

Analyze Vulnerable Smart Contracts (40 points):

Providing Sample Contracts (10 points):

Supply students with a set of sample Tezos smart contracts, each containing different types of vulnerabilities.
These vulnerabilities can include reentrancy, integer overflow, underflow, unauthorized access, or any other common security issues.
Analyzing Vulnerabilities (20 points):

Instruct students to thoroughly analyze the provided smart contracts to identify vulnerabilities.
They should document each vulnerability they find, explaining its nature and potential consequences.
Proposing Solutions (10 points):

Require students to propose solutions for fixing the identified vulnerabilities.
Emphasize the importance of applying best practices for secure smart contract development.
Documentation (30 points):

Request that students compile their vulnerability analysis and proposed solutions into a comprehensive report.
The report should include clear explanations of the vulnerabilities, the reasoning behind the proposed solutions, and code snippets if applicable.
Presentation (20 points):

Organize a presentation session where students will present their findings to the class or the instructor.
Each student should explain the vulnerabilities they identified, the potential risks, and their proposed solutions.
Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their vulnerability analysis report and any relevant documentation to the instructor or the designated platform provided for the assignment.
