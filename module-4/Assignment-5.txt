Security Audit

Course: Tezos Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to simulate a real-world security audit of a Tezos smart contract. Students will be tasked with performing a thorough security audit on a provided Tezos smart contract. They will analyze the contract code, looking for vulnerabilities and potential security risks, and produce a comprehensive security audit report outlining their findings and recommended fixes.

Instructions:

Assignment Task:

Security Audit of a Tezos Smart Contract (100 points):

Provided Tezos Smart Contract (20 points):

Provide students with a Tezos smart contract written in Michelson or Liquidity. The contract should be complex enough to challenge students in identifying security vulnerabilities.
Security Audit Process (40 points):

Instruct students to perform a systematic security audit of the provided smart contract.
Encourage students to use best practices for security audits, including code review, testing, and the use of static analysis tools if available.
Require students to thoroughly document their audit process, including the tools and techniques they used and the criteria they applied to identify security issues.
Security Findings (30 points):

Ask students to identify and document any security vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or potential risks they find in the smart contract.
Encourage students to categorize and prioritize their findings based on the severity of the issues.
Recommended Fixes (10 points):

Require students to propose recommended fixes or improvements for each identified security issue.
Students should provide clear explanations for why their recommended fixes enhance the security of the contract.
Security Audit Report (40 points):

Audit Report Structure (10 points):

Instruct students to create a well-structured security audit report that includes sections for an executive summary, methodology, findings, and recommended fixes.
Executive Summary (10 points):

Require students to provide a concise executive summary that highlights the most critical security findings and recommended actions.
Methodology (10 points):

Students should explain the methodology they used to conduct the security audit, including the tools and approaches employed.
Findings (5 points):

Encourage students to present their security findings clearly and comprehensively. Each finding should include a description of the issue, its potential impact, and how it was discovered.
Recommended Fixes (5 points):

Ensure that students provide detailed and actionable recommendations for addressing the identified security issues.
Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their security audit report along with the original provided smart contract to the instructor or the designated platform provided for the assignment.
