SmartPy Smart Contract

Course: Tezos Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to provide students with hands-on experience in developing Tezos smart contracts using the SmartPy development framework. Students will be tasked with creating a Tezos smart contract that meets specific requirements, deploying it to a Tezos testnet, and documenting the deployment process.

Instructions:

Assignment Task:

SmartPy Smart Contract Development (80 points):

Scenario Description (10 points):

Provide students with a scenario that requires the development of a Tezos smart contract. The scenario should be realistic and include specific requirements that the smart contract must fulfill.
SmartPy Development (40 points):

Instruct students to use the SmartPy development framework to create the Tezos smart contract based on the provided scenario and requirements.
Encourage students to leverage the capabilities of SmartPy for contract development, testing, and simulation.
Ensure that the contract includes relevant functionality and adheres to best practices for smart contract development.
Testing (20 points):

Require students to thoroughly test their SmartPy smart contract to ensure that it functions as intended.
Encourage them to create test cases that cover different contract scenarios and edge cases.
Students should document their testing process and provide evidence of successful testing.
Deployment and Documentation (20 points):

Testnet Deployment (10 points):

Instruct students to deploy their SmartPy smart contract to a Tezos testnet. They should use a testnet wallet and document the deployment steps, including any challenges they encounter and how they overcome them.
Deployment Documentation (10 points):

Require students to create clear and concise documentation of the deployment process. The documentation should include step-by-step instructions, screenshots, and explanations of key deployment decisions.
Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their SmartPy smart contract code, testing documentation, evidence of successful testing, and deployment documentation to the instructor or the designated platform provided for the assignment.
