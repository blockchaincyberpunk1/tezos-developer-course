Real-World Application

Course: Tezos Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to encourage students to apply their advanced smart contract development skills to solve a real-world problem using Tezos. Students will identify a practical use case and create a complete solution, which could be a decentralized application (dApp), a governance mechanism, or a custom token with unique properties. This assignment aims to assess their ability to design and implement sophisticated Tezos smart contracts and document the development process.

Instructions:

Assignment Task:

Identify a Real-World Use Case (10 points):

Instruct students to research and identify a real-world problem or scenario that can be addressed using Tezos smart contracts.
Encourage them to think creatively and select a use case that requires advanced contract functionality.
Design and Plan (20 points):

Ask students to create a detailed design and plan for their Tezos smart contract solution.
This should include specifying the contract's objectives, its interaction with users, and any novel features it will offer.
Students should provide a high-level architecture of their solution.
Smart Contract Development (40 points):

Development Phase (30 points):

Assign students the task of developing the Tezos smart contract to address the selected real-world use case.
Encourage them to use the appropriate Tezos-specific smart contract language (e.g., Michelson or Liquidity) and ensure that the contract is well-commented and readable.
Testing Phase (10 points):

Instruct students to thoroughly test their smart contract on a Tezos testnet or other suitable environment.
They should identify and resolve any bugs or issues encountered during testing.
Documentation and Final Solution (20 points):

Request that students provide comprehensive documentation for their Tezos smart contract, including the contract's purpose, functions, and user interaction.
Students should also document the development process, challenges faced, and the solutions implemented.
They must submit the final working solution of their Tezos smart contract along with clear instructions on how it can be interacted with.
Presentation (10 points):

Organize a presentation session where students will present their Tezos smart contract solutions to the class or the instructor.
Each student should explain their use case, the contract's design, its features, and how it addresses the real-world problem.
Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their smart contract code, detailed documentation, and any relevant files or resources to the instructor or the designated platform provided for the assignment.
