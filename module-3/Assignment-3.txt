Complex Smart Contracts

Course: Tezos Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to challenge students with complex smart contract development scenarios on the Tezos blockchain. Students will design, implement, and test a Tezos smart contract to address a real-world problem that requires intricate logic.

Instructions:

Assignment Task:

Complex Smart Contract Development

Introduction (10 points):

Explain the significance of complex smart contracts in real-world blockchain applications.
Introduce the assignment's objective: to design, implement, and test a Tezos smart contract to address a challenging real-world problem.
Highlight the potential use cases that complex smart contracts can solve (e.g., multi-signature wallets, DeFi protocols, governance mechanisms).
Problem Description (20 points):

Provide students with a detailed real-world problem that requires a complex smart contract solution. The problem should involve multiple stakeholders, intricate rules, or governance requirements.
Examples of problems:
Design a multi-signature wallet contract for a consortium of organizations with specific signing requirements.
Create a decentralized lending platform with lending and borrowing rules governed by smart contracts.
Develop a governance mechanism for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with voting rules and proposals.
Ensure that the problem is challenging and necessitates complex contract logic.
Smart Contract Design (30 points):

Instruct students to design the Tezos smart contract that addresses the problem.
Encourage them to consider factors like contract storage, entry points, state transitions, and governance rules.
Students should provide a clear outline of their contract's architecture, including diagrams if applicable.
Smart Contract Implementation (30 points):

Assign students the task of implementing the smart contract in Michelson or another Tezos-specific smart contract language (e.g., LIGO).
Encourage thorough testing during the development phase.
Students should document the code and any challenges they encountered during implementation.
Testing and Deployment (10 points):

Request that students thoroughly test the smart contract to ensure its functionality and security.
Once testing is successful, they should deploy the contract on a Tezos testnet or other suitable environment.
Provide evidence of successful deployment.
Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their smart contract code, design documentation, testing results, and deployment evidence to the instructor or the designated platform provided for the assignment.
