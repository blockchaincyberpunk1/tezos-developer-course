Setting Up a Tezos Node

Course: Tezos Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students how to set up and configure a Tezos node. Students will gain hands-on experience in installing and configuring a Tezos node on their local development environment, which is a fundamental skill for Tezos development.

Instructions:

Assignment Task:

Setting Up a Tezos Node

Introduction (10 points):

Begin by explaining the importance of setting up a Tezos node for Tezos development.
Highlight the significance of understanding the node's role in the Tezos network.
Node Installation (40 points):

Instruct students to install a Tezos node on their local development environment (e.g., Linux, macOS, or Windows).
Provide clear step-by-step instructions for the installation process, including the following:
Downloading the Tezos software.
Setting up dependencies and prerequisites.
