Michelson Smart Contract Development

Course: Tezos Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to provide students with hands-on experience in creating Michelson smart contracts on the Tezos platform. Students will develop a Michelson smart contract that demonstrates basic functionality and then deploy and test it on a Tezos testnet.

Instructions:

Assignment Task:

Michelson Smart Contract Development

Introduction (10 points):

Begin by explaining the importance of practical experience in Michelson smart contract development.
Emphasize the significance of writing efficient, secure, and functional smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain.
Smart Contract Use Case (10 points):

Present students with a choice of smart contract use cases. These could include creating a token contract, implementing a voting system, or any other simple but practical scenario.
Explain the selected use case and its expected functionality.
Smart Contract Development (50 points):

Assign students the task of developing a Michelson smart contract based on the chosen use case. Students should write clean, well-documented Michelson code that adheres to best practices.
Encourage students to think critically about their contract's logic and consider security implications.
Contract Deployment (10 points):

Instruct students to deploy their Michelson smart contract on a Tezos testnet. Provide guidance on how to deploy contracts using available tools or platforms.
Students should ensure that the contract deployment is successful and record the contract address.
Testing and Evaluation (10 points):

Ask students to create test scenarios for their smart contracts. They should test different aspects of the contract's functionality.
Encourage students to document the testing process and ensure that the contract behaves as expected.
Documentation and Reflection (10 points):

Assign students to document their Michelson code thoroughly, including explanations of contract functions and any relevant comments.
Request that students write a reflection on their experience, highlighting any challenges faced during development and deployment.
Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their Michelson smart contract code, documentation, contract deployment details, testing scenarios and results, and a reflection on their experience to the instructor or the designated platform provided for the assignment.
