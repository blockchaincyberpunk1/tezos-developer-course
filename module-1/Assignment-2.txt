Assignment Task:

Tezos vs. Other Blockchains Comparison

Select Blockchain Platforms (10 points):

Instruct students to choose at least two other blockchain platforms to compare with Tezos. Common choices include Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other relevant blockchains.
Comparison Categories (30 points):

Provide students with a list of categories to compare, which may include:
Architecture: How is Tezos' architecture different from the selected blockchain platforms? Discuss aspects such as its layered architecture, on-chain governance, and self-amendment.
Consensus Mechanisms: Explain Tezos' proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and compare it to the consensus mechanisms used by the other platforms (e.g., PoW for Bitcoin, PoS for Ethereum 2.0).
Smart Contract Languages: Explore Tezos' smart contract languages (e.g., Michelson) and compare them to the languages used on other platforms (e.g., Solidity for Ethereum).
Governance Model: Describe Tezos' on-chain governance model, including its role in protocol upgrades, and compare it to the governance models of the selected platforms.
Scalability and Performance: Analyze Tezos' scalability features and compare them to the scalability challenges faced by other platforms.
Ecosystem and Adoption: Evaluate the current state of Tezos' ecosystem, developer tools, and adoption in comparison to the other platforms.
Research and Analysis (40 points):

Instruct students to thoroughly research and analyze each of the comparison categories.
Encourage students to provide quantitative data, where available, and cite credible sources to support their comparisons.
Ensure that students critically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each blockchain in the respective categories.
Report or Presentation (20 points):

Ask students to compile their research findings into a well-structured report or presentation.
Emphasize the importance of clear and concise explanations, using appropriate terminology and examples to illustrate the comparisons.
If students are creating presentations, encourage them to use visuals, diagrams, or slides to enhance their presentations and make the content more engaging.
Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their comparative analysis report or presentation to the instructor or the designated platform provided for the assignment.
