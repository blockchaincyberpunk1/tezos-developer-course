Tezos Testnet Deployment

Course: Tezos Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to provide students with practical experience in deploying a smart contract on the Tezos testnet using Tezos-specific smart contract languages.

Instructions:

Assignment Task:

Tezos Testnet Deployment

Setting Up the Environment (10 points):

Instruct students to set up their development environment for Tezos smart contract development. This should include installing Tezos-specific tools and smart contract development environments like LIGO or SmartPy.
Smart Contract Development (30 points):

Assign students the task of creating a simple smart contract using one of the Tezos-specific smart contract languages (e.g., Michelson, LIGO, or SmartPy).
Encourage creativity but specify that the smart contract should demonstrate fundamental concepts (e.g., token issuance, delegation, simple application logic).
Ensure that students follow best practices and coding standards while developing the smart contract.
Testnet Deployment (40 points):

Guide students through the process of deploying their smart contract on the Tezos testnet.
Instruct students to obtain testnet XTZ (Tezos tokens) if not already provided and use them for deploying and interacting with the smart contract.
Encourage students to test the smart contract's functionality thoroughly on the testnet.
Documentation and Submission (20 points):

Require students to create comprehensive documentation for their smart contract, including its purpose, functionality, and usage instructions.
Ask students to submit their smart contract code, any scripts or tools used for deployment, and the documentation to the instructor or the designated platform provided for the assignment.
Submission Guidelines:

Students should submit their smart contract code, deployment scripts/tools, and documentation to the instructor or the designated platform provided for the assignment.
Grading Rubric:
